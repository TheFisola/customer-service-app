It has been caused by a temporal stagnation from my employment that was abruptly halted due to funding issues. Need to request for a little time extra as I commit myself to clear this loan I have. Kindly respond we agree on an amicable plan if payment. My Tel: 0723 496 592. Waiting for your feedback.   Regards,  Kenedy Sifuma"
